# Final Project

The following Python modules are required to run this pipeline:

numpy
opencv
scipy

Once these are installed, inside the main.py file under the main() function, simply
uncomment the image you want to render and run main.py. The show_img flag is set
to True so it will utilize the cv2.imshow() method. If this is being run in an
environment without that capability change show_img=True to show_img=False
